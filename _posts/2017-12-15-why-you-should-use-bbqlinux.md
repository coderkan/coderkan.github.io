Hi everyone,

I have developed applications like **Desktop**, **Embedded**, **Android** for 3 years and have heavily developing Android development on [AntriKod Software](www.antrikod.com) for amount 2 years. When I developed Android application, I have used various Operation System like Windows, Ubuntu, Mint and the last one is **BBQLinux**. 

I would like to say something Operation Systems that I used. Firstly, I have used **Windows** Operation System like everyone. But this issue has not satisfied because it is normally slower when I use **Android Studio** and not a good performance for **Android Development** for me. I always think that alternative ways that I used programs, application, OS to try out.

So first alternative to use Operation System is **Ubuntu** from Linux side. During the first time developing Android in **Ubuntu** is greater than **Windows**. Because working on **Linux** side is exciting to me. I always think that a developer must have information on Linux. Development tools, Open Source are essential issue. Then **Ubuntu** is getting slower when I used it long term. For example, I have working on 4 hours on an application and after 2 hours my **PC** getting warm and getting slower. So that this manner is not good impact for me.

I have some googling then I'm not happy working with Ubuntu. Because Development time passing is not good that I expected. After googling I have decided to use Arch based Linux distro. I just want to a distro includes tools for Android Developments. For example in OS have Android Studio, Android SDK, Inkscape, Gimp etc I need when I develop an application. First important thing for me is to work faster. I found a distro that based on Arch Linux is [BBQLinux](http://bbqlinux.org/).

BBQLinux is made for Android Developers. 

BBQLinux is user-friendly Linux distrobution for Android Developers. The biggest pros of using BBQLinux is you don't need to reinstall the latest release of BBQLinux. Because this is using **Rolling Release Development Model** which means it is getting continually updated and upgraded.
lt's also fully compatible Arch Linux packages because of based on Arch Linux. This is an Open Source Project so you can download and contribute on [Github](https://github.com/bbqlinux ).

This Operation System is awesome. Because this distro designed for Android Developers. You don't need to install other things for Development.

Just update and go ahead Development. I will share my experiences. First thing is I love in The  BBQLinux is **stability**. It has good work on this issue. I can work on long hours and work good performance. I can work on more than one Android Studio Project and working well. This is big happiness for me. Other distros can not work well this issues that I experienced.

I hope you use this distro and say to me your experience.

I hope you enjoy reading.

Have a nice coding...
