Hi everyone,

GUI tools make our work easier. Today, many people prefer the use of these tools. I prefer terminal based systems instead of these interfaces. In particular, I don't need to use any GUI in the **git** tool.

My friends often criticize my use of the terminal instead of the GUI.
But I think the terminal environment is more flexible and useful.

My friends say that the GUI is a good option, especially for more comfortable observations of commitments. I will try to show you what we can do with the terminal against this situation.

I will elaborate with a few examples.

Using the terminal, I can print the screen in the format I want. In short this is ease of use for me.

I hope your thoughts about using the terminal have changed a bit.

Good work
